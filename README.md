- 👋 Hi, I’m Taniwharau, that means one hundred monsters hahah!! true. Taniwha means dragon rau = 100, so Our tribe is made up of over 100 subtribes known as Ngapuhi taniwharau.
- 👀 Mostly we didnt get on with each other, and so as we are naturaly a fighting tribe we only unified as one tribe when other tribes needed payback.
     Decentralisation appeals to me as we have tried to exercise our sovereignty to combine our subtribes throughout NZ, however the central European Govt has raided our ofices from time to time 
- 🌱 Ive just started this course on github and want to get into how to write code and build a trustless, non agressive, open source system of registration/interaction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who may have a similar program.
